The minimum elements of an SBOM build on three broad, interrelated areas: Data fields, Operational considerations, and Support for automation. SBOMs must comply with at least one of the following SBOM standards: Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX), CycloneDX, or Software Identification (SWID) tags. The minimum elements of an SBOM will enable basic use cases, such as management of vulnerabilities, software inventory, and licenses. <em><div style="float:right;">2021-07-12</div></em></p><h2 id="white-house-executive-order-14028" tabindex="-1">White House Executive Order 14028 <div style="float:right;">🇺🇸</div> <a class="header-anchor" href="#white-house-executive-order-14028" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;White House Executive Order 14028 &lt;div style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;:us:&lt;/div&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">White House Executive Order on cybersecurity</a> includes new security requirements for software vendors selling software to the U.S. government.
