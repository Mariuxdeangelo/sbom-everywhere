### SBOM

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a structured record that identifies the components and their relationships within a software product. It functions like an ingredients list, detailing the various software components and their versions that make up a final software product. This record helps with transparency in the software supply chain, enabling better understanding, management, and ultimately, improved security of the software.
